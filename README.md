# Sound_classification_ML
  Implement Supervised learning to classify the sound.

# Why CNN?
   In order to achieve sound classification based on the Mel Spectrogram Array, usually it requires great level of expertise. However, CNN only requires a data and label with consistency. 
  
# Procedure

1. Change the wav file into Mel Spectrogram Array

2. Label the Mel Spectrogram
  0 = Air Conditioner
  1 = Car Horn
  2 = Children Playing
  3 = Dog Bark
  4 = Drilling
  5 = Engine Idling
  6 = Gun Shot
  7 = Jackhammer
  8 = Siren
  9 = Street Music

3. Put Mel Spectrogram Array and Label into CNN

4. Get the Result
